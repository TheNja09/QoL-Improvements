title: QoL Improvements
description: An ongoing mod that aims to provide QoL improvements to various movement abilities and other gameplay mechanics. Currently, this mod lets you run faster the longer you are running, gives you a higher FOV, slightly speeds up the chest opening animation, includes better glide movement, and removes most of the speed decay from Quick Run.
